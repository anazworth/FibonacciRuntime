Assignment analyzing the runtime differences between the recursive and iterative Fibonacci functions.

### Problem:
> - Implement the Fibonacci function in both a recursive and iterative fashion.
> - Find the runtime of each function.
> - Find the time (in nanoseconds) it takes to run each function.
> - Form a table from the function results.
